# ubuntu setup

This repo contains instructions, scripts, and reminders for setting up my personal Ubuntu (20.04) machine. Below are instructions on using scripts to automatically set up the main things as well as instructions for other items.

Clone using `git clone https://github.com/wzhorton/ubuntu_setup` into user's home directory. Be sure to have sudo privelages. Move into the new directory.

Edit the Display Settings such that monitor resolution, frame rate, and position are satisfactory.

Run the main file with `./main.sh` to execute the primary setup sequence. If needed (not likely), make it executable by first running `chmod +x main.sh`. Be prepared to enter y and a few passphrases as each step does not have a -y flag set. 

Activate the native red shift program "Night Light" within Display Settings. Alternatively, the package `redshift-gtk` is functional. Sadly, the very popular f.lux is not functional on Linux. Additionally, change your background wallpaper.
